Across Lite Puzzle Player

This app will allow crossword puzzles in the Across Lite format to be played
on the Panic Playdate.  Across Lite is a standard format for downloadable
crossword puzzles used by many media organizations.  Some access to these
puzzles is behind a paywall but a number of them are freely available for
download.  A site that I have found useful for downloading these puzzles
is:

The Crossword app has two main screens.  1) the puzzle selection screen and
2) The puzzle play screen.  Following are the button options for each:

Puzzle Selection Screen

Up/Down     Select puzzle
A           Open puzzle
B           Delete puzzle (press 3 times to delete)

Puzzle Play Screen

D-Pad       Used to select current letter cell
A           Selects the next letter
B+A         Selects the previous letter (hold B and press A)
B           Change word selection from across to down and vice versa
Crank       The crank may be used for letter selection.  Turn clockwise for
            next letter(s) and counter-clockwise for previous.

On the Puzzle Play Screen there are menu options for checking and removing errors.
Also an "exit puzzle" option will return to the Puzzle Selection Screen.  The
current state of the puzzle is saved when the Play screen is exited and is
restored on reentry to that puzzle.

Crossword comes with 3 puzzles built into the app.  These are as follows and since
they are part of the executable they cannot be deleted.

Mostly Musical Mini 23.puz
Name That Tune.puz
wsj230929.puz

Puzzle files that you download must be placed in the puzzle directory of the
Crossword app.  Unfortunately, at present, the only way to do this is by connecting
the Playdate to a computer via USB.  Once the Playdate is connected to your PC/Mac
if it does not appear as a drive then on the Playdate system menu select the following:

settings -> System -> Reboot to Data Disk

Once connected your .puz files should be placed in the following folder:

Data -> com.bwit.crossword -> puzzles

This app will only work with valid Across Lite puzzle files.  These files contain
internal checksums used to validate the integrity of the file.  I've found that a
number of these files don't seem to calculate the checksum correctly even though
the file is fine and perfectly playable.  As a result I've disabled validation of
the checksum in the hopes that the maximum number of files will be available for
you to play.  If this proves to be a problem for folks I will issue a new version
the reinstates the checksum validation.  In that case files with bad checksums
will refuse to open.

Until the past few years the New York Times published their crosswords in Across
Lite format.  They decided to stop doing that in 2021 or 2022, not sure exactly
when.  At any rate I've providing a ZIP archive of most, if not all, of the NYT
puzzles published in Across Lite.

Please feel free to let me know if you encounter errors or uncover bugs in the
app.
