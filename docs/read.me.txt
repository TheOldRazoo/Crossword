Across Lite Puzzle Player

This app will allow crossword puzzles in the Across Lite format to be played
on the Panic Playdate.  Across Lite is a standard format for downloadable
crossword puzzles used by many media organizations.  Some access to these
puzzles is behind a paywall but a number of them are freely available for
download.  A site that I have found useful for downloading these puzzles
is:

The Crossword app has two main screens.  1) the puzzle selection screen and
2) The puzzle play screen.  Following are the button options for each:

Puzzle Selection Screen

Up/Down     Select puzzle
Left        Return to parent folder (if exists)
Right       Open the last puzzle worked if it exists
A           Open puzzle
B           Delete puzzle (press 3 times to delete)

Puzzle Play Screen

D-Pad       Used to select current letter cell
A           Selects the next letter
B+A         Selects the previous letter (hold B and press A)
B+Left      Select the letter 10 places previous
B+Right     Advances the current letter by 10 places
B+Up        Find previous blank cell
B+Down      Find next blank cell
B           Change word selection from across to down and vice versa
Crank       The crank may be used for letter selection.  Turn clockwise for
            next letter(s) and counter-clockwise for previous.

On the Puzzle Play Screen there are menu options for checking and removing errors.
Also an "exit puzzle" option will return to the Puzzle Selection Screen.  The
current state of the puzzle is saved when the Play screen is exited and is
restored on reentry to that puzzle.

Crossword comes with 3 puzzles built into the app.  These are as follows and since
they are part of the executable they cannot be deleted.

Mostly Musical Mini 23.puz

Puzzle files that you download must be placed in the puzzle directory of the
Crossword app.  Unfortunately, at present, the only way to do this is by connecting
the Playdate to a computer via USB.  Once the Playdate is connected to your PC/Mac
if it does not appear as a drive then on the Playdate system menu select the following:

settings -> System -> Reboot to Data Disk

Once connected your .puz files should be placed in the following folder:

Data -> com.bwit.crossword -> puzzles

If the game was installed from the play.date web site this folder may be named:

Data -> user.xxxx.com.bwit.crossword -> puzzles

Note that you can create sub folders to organize your puzzles if you so desire.  The
puzzle selection screen will allow the hierarchy to be traversed to select the puzzle
you wish to play.  Creating subfolders is not required.

Panic's instructions for sideloading games can be found here:

This app will only work with valid Across Lite puzzle files.  These files contain
internal checksums used to validate the integrity of the file.  I've found that a
number of these files don't seem to calculate the checksum correctly even though
the file is fine and perfectly playable.  As a result I've disabled validation of
the checksum in the hopes that the maximum number of files will be available for
you to play.  If this proves to be a problem for folks I will issue a new version
the reinstates the checksum validation.  In that case files with bad checksums
will refuse to open.

Playing background music
Version 1.60 and higher support playing background music in the puzzle play screen.
To enable this feature place one or more MP3 files in the following folder:

Data -> com.bwit.crossword -> music

If MP3 files exist in this folder one will randomly be selected each time you enter
a puzzle and will play in the background.

Background music may be toggled on/off in the options menu.  This setting will be saved
and remain in effect until changed.

A nice selection of relaxing music is available at:

Please feel free to let me know if you encounter errors or uncover bugs in the
app.
